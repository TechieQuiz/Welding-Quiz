    "choices": [
      "Promotes fine grain structure.",
      "Increases strength and responsiveness to heat treatment, but lowers toughness.",

      "The Fusion Zone (FZ)",
      "The Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ)",
      "The Weld Metal Zone (WMZ)",
      "The Transformation Zone (TZ)"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The region of base metal adjacent to the weld that experienced metallurgical changes but did not melt is called the Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ)."

  {
    "q": "Which of the following is NOT one of the four independent conditions required for the formation of delayed cracks in the HAZ?",
    "choices": [
      "The presence of hydrogen",
      "A susceptible microstructure",
      "The presence of stress",
      "High interpass temperature"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explain": "The four conditions are hydrogen presence, susceptible microstructure, presence of stress, and low temperature. High interpass temperature tends to prevent delayed cracking."
